## Architecture
SQLite Cloud uses the [Raft](https://raft.github.io) consensus algorithm to distribute your data changes across a cluster of computing systems, ensuring that each node in the cluster agrees upon the same series of state transitions. Raft implements consensus with a leader approach.

SQLite Cloud is written in ANSI C and GO, and it works on most POSIX systems (Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X) and Windows. 

SQLite Cloud supports all the SQLite features without any limitations, including ACID compliance and non-deterministic SQL statements.
