**SQLite Cloud** is a managed, distributed relational database system built on top of the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database engine. It is written in ANSI C and GO, and it works on most POSIX systems like Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X (Windows is supported too). You can use SQLite Cloud from the most popular programming languages or its REST API.

## Architecture
SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database engine designed for single-user applications. Its databases are self-contained in single files, making them ideal for embedded systems and local applications.

SQLite Cloud brings multi-user, multi-device, and global distribution capabilities to SQLite by running SQLite in a multi-node cluster environment. Each node runs the official SQLite database engine. The databases (files) in the cluster stay synchronized through the [Raft](https://raft.github.io) consensus algorithm - an industry-standard protocol that ensures all nodes maintain consistent copies of your data.. Synchronization happens automatically and in the background.

SQLite Cloud exposes identical APIs to SQLite, so you can interact with your cloud databases like you would if they were stored on your local file system.

SQLite Cloud supports both strong and eventual consistency, and comes with a multi-region load balancer to ensure optimal performance.

### The Official SQLite
SQLite Cloud is built on the open source SQLite engine, ensuring complete feature parity. You get all of SQLite's core strengths: ACID compliance, support for complex SQL operations, and compatibility with the rich SQLite extension ecosystem.

Like SQLite, each database in SQLite Cloud is a separate file, giving you flexible deployment options:

* Create separate databases for each customer in a multi-tenant application
* Share a single database among multiple users with built-in access controls
* Mix both approaches based on your application's needs


## CloudSync: Enabling Local-First Applications (Alpha Preview)

We're developing CloudSync, a powerful SQLite extension that brings local-first capabilities to your applications. This feature is currently in alpha testing with select partners.

Here's how it works:

1. Create a connection to a local SQLite database using any language and driver you'd like.
2. Install the CloudSync extension.
3. Execute a special SQL function to initialize tracking of specific tables.
4. Execute another SQL function, passing in your cloud connection string to establish a relationship between your local database file and your cloud database file.
4. Define row-level security rules to control what data is synced to a given user's device.
5. Run a read query to sync your local database with the cloud.

Then, whenever you write to your local database, changes are automatically synchronized with the cloud, and distributed to any other devices that have access to the changed rows. 

No network connection? No problem. Changes from multiple users or devices are synced conflict-free when the network connection is restored thanks to [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type). 

We are excited to bring this extension to the SQLite community, and are actively looking for private beta testers. Please [contact us](https://sqlitecloud.io/support) if you'd like to learn more.

## A Complete Toolbox
SQLite Cloud also provides a comprehensive suite of tools for building realtime, local-first applications.
* **[Webhooks](/docs/webhooks)**: Trigger edge functions or send change payloads via HTTP, Websockets, or on database events like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
* **[Edge Functions](/docs/edge-functions)**: Run serverless functions on the same nodes that store your data for lightning-fast data access.
* **[Pub/Sub](/docs/pub-sub)**: Subscribe to changes in your database to replicate data, power notifications, and build multiplayer experiences.
* **[Weblite](/docs/weblite)**: Autogenerated REST APIs to interact with the SQLite Cloud platform.
* **[Query Analyzer](/docs/analyzer)**: Receive optimization recommendations for your queries to improve performance.
