**SQLite Cloud** is a managed, distributed relational database system built on top of the SQLite database engine. It is written in ANSI C and GO, and it works on most POSIX systems like Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X (Windows is supported too). You can use SQLite Cloud from the most popular programming languages or its REST API.

## Multi-node Architecture
Every SQLite Cloud project is powered by a multi-node cluster, where each node is running the official SQLite database engine. The cluster uses the [Raft](https://raft.github.io) consensus algorithm to keep your underlying database files in sync across nodes. All of this happens in the background, so you can interact with your database as if it were a single, local database.

SQLite Cloud supports both strong and eventual consistency, and comes with a multi-region load balancer to ensure optimal performance.

## The Official SQLite
When you interact with a SQLite Cloud database, you are interacting with the official open source SQLite engine. This means SQLite Cloud supports all the same features as SQLite. It is fully ACID compliant, supports non-deterministic SQL statements, and is compatible with the SQLite extension ecosystem.\

It also means that you can have as many or as few databases as you want - each database is a file. This means SQLite Cloud can be used for both multi-tenant applications (single-user database), and as a multi-tenant database (one database, many users).

## CloudSync and Row-level Security (in alpha)
We are currently in the process of building a local-first SQLite extension called "CloudSync". Once installed, you can use any driver you'd like - simply execute a custom SQL function passing in your cloud connection string, and any changes to your local database are automatically synchronized with the cloud and across devices. Offline-first comes "out of the box", and CRDTs are used to ensure merges are conflict-free.

CloudSync will also bring row-level security to SQLite for the first time, giving you control over what data is synced to a given user's device.

## A Complete Toolbox
SQLite Cloud also provides a comprehensive suite of tools for building realtime, local-first applications.
* **[Webhooks](/docs/webhooks)**: Trigger edge functions or send change payloads via HTTP, Websockets, or on database events like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
* **[Edge Functions](/docs/edge-functions)**: Run serverless functions on the same nodes that store your data for lightning-fast data access.
* **[Pub/Sub](/docs/pub-sub)**: Subscribe to changes in your database to replicate data, power notifications, and build multiplayer experiences.
* **[Weblite](/docs/weblite)**: Autogenerated REST APIs to interact with your database and edge functions.
* **[Query Analyzer](/docs/analyzer)**: Receive optimization recommendations for your queries to improve performance.
