## Overview
**SQLite Cloud** is a managed, distributed relational database system built on top of the SQLite database engine. 

It has been designed from the ground up to ensure strong consistency across all nodes in a cluster while simultaneously managing the technical aspects of scaling, security, and data distribution. This ensures that you can focus on your core tasks while relying on SQLite Cloud to handle the complexities of managing your databases.

You can access SQLite Cloud from the most popular programming languages or its REST API. 

### Features
SQLite Cloud provides a comprehensive suite of tools for building realtime, local-first, edge AI applications.
* **Local Sync**: Read and write to your local SQLite database, then synchronize with the cloud and across devices in the background. (**alpha**)
* **Offline-first**: Automatically resolve conflicts between devices and the cloud with CRDTs. (**alpha**)
* **[Webhooks](/docs/webhooks)**: Send changes in your database to an external webhook or use to trigger actions.
* **[Edge Functions](/docs/edge-functions)**: Run serverless functions next to your database. Trigger via HTTP endpoint or on database operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
* **[Pub/Sub](/docs/pub-sub)**: Subscribe to changes in your database to replicate data, power notifications, and build multiplayer experiences.
* **[Weblite](/docs/weblite)**: Autogenerated REST APIs to interact with your database and edge functions.
* **[Query Analyzer](/docs/analyzer)**: Receive optimization recommendations for your queries to improve performance.
* **Multi-region Load Balancer**: Connect from anywhere and SQLite Cloud automatically routes traffic to the nearest node for optimal performance.
