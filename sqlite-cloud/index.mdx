## Overview
**SQLite Cloud** is a managed, distributed relational database system built on top of the SQLite database engine. 

It has been designed from the ground up to ensure strong consistency across all nodes in a cluster while simultaneously managing the technical aspects of scaling, security, and data distribution. This ensures that you can focus on your core tasks while relying on SQLite Cloud to handle the complexities of managing your databases.

SQLite Cloud is built on the open source SQLite engine, ensuring complete feature parity. You get all of SQLite's core strengths: ACID compliance, support for complex SQL operations, and compatibility with the rich SQLite extension ecosystem.

You can access SQLite Cloud from the most popular programming languages or its REST API. 

Like SQLite, each database in SQLite Cloud is a separate file, giving you flexible deployment options:

* Create separate databases for each customer in a multi-tenant application
* Share a single database among multiple users with built-in access controls
* Mix both approaches based on your application's needs

### Features
SQLite Cloud provides a comprehensive suite of tools for building realtime, local-first, edge AI applications.
* **[Webhooks](/docs/webhooks)**: Trigger edge functions or send change payloads via HTTP, Websockets, or on database events like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
* **[Edge Functions](/docs/edge-functions)**: Run serverless functions on the same nodes that store your data for lightning-fast data access.
* **[Pub/Sub](/docs/pub-sub)**: Subscribe to changes in your database to replicate data, power notifications, and build multiplayer experiences.
* **[Weblite](/docs/weblite)**: Autogenerated REST APIs to interact with the SQLite Cloud platform.
* **[Query Analyzer](/docs/analyzer)**: Receive optimization recommendations for your queries to improve performance.
