[SQLite-AI](https://website-stage.sqlitecloud.io/sqlite-ai) is a groundbreaking extension that brings powerful AI capabilities directly into SQLite. By embedding llama and whisper, it enables local LLM inference, text generation, embedding creation, speech recognition, translation, and even multimodal support, all from within the database itself.

With a simple SQL interface, you can chat with a model, stream tokens in real time, generate high-quality embeddings, or transcribe and translate audio using Whisper. Multimodal features allow image processing and embedding, making SQLite-AI a versatile foundation for modern AI applications.

**SQLite-AI** is an open-source project available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-ai).
