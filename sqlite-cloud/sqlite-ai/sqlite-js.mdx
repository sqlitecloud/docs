[SQLite-JS](https://website-stage.sqlitecloud.io/sqlite-js) is a powerful extension that lets you write custom cross-platform logic directly in your SQLite database using JavaScript. With support for scalar, aggregate, window functions, and collation sequences, you can express complex operations with ease, all using familiar SQL syntax.

By integrating SQLite-JS with [SQLite-Sync](sqlite-sync), your user-defined JavaScript functions are automatically synchronized across all clients connected to your cluster, keeping logic consistent everywhere, even offline, for a truly consistent offline-first server-side logic distribution.

**SQLite-JS** is an open-source project available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-js).
