[SQLite-Sync](https://website-stage.sqlitecloud.io/sqlite-sync) is a cross-platform extension that adds built-in offline support and automatic synchronization to standard SQLite databases, enabling a **true local-first experience with zero latency**. Applications can operate fully offline, with each device maintaining its own copy of the database

When reconnected, all changes are seamlessly synchronized across devices. Developers can continue using the familiar simplicity and performance of SQLite while easily building distributed, collaborative applications without complex infrastructure.

SQLite Sync is powered by CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types), a class of algorithms designed for real-time collaboration and distributed systems. CRDTs ensure that changes made on different devices are merged automatically and without conflicts, even when made offline. This means no data loss, no overwrites, and no need for manual conflict resolution. Whether it's a multi-user app or a fleet of devices operating in the field, SQLite Sync keeps everything consistent and in sync automatically.

**SQLite-Sync** is an open-source project available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-sync).
