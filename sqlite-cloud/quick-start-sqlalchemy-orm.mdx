title: SQLAlchemy ORM Quick Start Guide
description: Get started with SQLite Cloud using SQLAlchemy ORM in FastAPI.
category: getting-started

slug: quick-start-sqlalchemy-orm
---

In this Quick Start, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud by building a FastAPI backend that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database using SQLAlchemy.

NOTE that FastAPI framework:
  - does NOT require you to use a relational database or any database at all.
  - CAN work with any ORM library (including SQLAlchemy) or database (including SQLite, which comes pre-installed in Python and is a database supported by SQLAlchemy).
  - code is MINIMAL in the example below. Most of the code is standard SQLAlchemy and framework-agnostic.

---

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
  - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://dashboard.sqlitecloud.io/auth/sign-in) and create a new project.
  - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.

2. **Create a new Python project**
  - You should have the latest Python version (3) installed locally.

```bash
mkdir sqlalchemy-quickstart
cd sqlalchemy-quickstart

# open the project in VSCode / another editor
code .

python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
  - Run this command from your current directory:

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]" sqlalchemy sqlalchemy-sqlitecloud
```

  - Do NOT remove the quotes around the FastAPI package.
  - `sqlalchemy-sqlitecloud` includes `sqlitecloud`, so no need to install the latter separately.

4. **App setup**
  - From your current directory, create a sub-directory `fastapi_sqlc_app` with an empty `__init__.py` file to indicate the new sub-directory is a package.
    - NOTE: We will create all remaining project files in this sub-directory.

```bash
mkdir fastapi_sqlc_app
cd fastapi_sqlc_app
touch __init__.py
```

  - Create a new file `database.py` and copy in the following code.
    - In your SQLite Cloud account dashboard, click on `Show connection strings`, copy the Connection String, and replace `<your-connection-string>` below. Modify your string to include the name of the DB we'll query: `sqlitecloud://{hostname}:8860/chinook.sqlite?apikey={apikey}`.

```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

engine = create_engine('<your-connection-string>')

SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

Base = declarative_base()
```

  - Create a new file `models.py` and copy in the following code defining 2 SQLAlchemy ORM "models", or classes, to interact with the DB.
    - `__tablename__` is the name of a model's corresponding DB table.
    - The `Album` class' `id` attribute maps to the `AlbumId` column in the `albums` table. All other class attribute names match their corresponding table column names.

```py
from .database import Base

from sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String

class Artist(Base):
    __tablename__ = "artists"

    ArtistId = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    Name = Column(String)

class Album(Base):
    __tablename__ = "albums"

    id = Column("AlbumId", Integer, primary_key=True)
    Title = Column(String)
    ArtistId = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('artists.ArtistId'))
```

  - Create a new file `schemas.py` and copy in the following code defining a Pydantic model, or "schema", to validate the shape of the response data.

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AlbumResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    Title: str
    ArtistName: str
```

  - Create a new file `read.py` and copy in the following code creating a reusable utility function to read album data.

```py
from . import models

from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def get_albums(db: Session, skip: int = 0, num: int = 20):
    return db.query(models.Album.id, models.Album.Title, models.Artist.Name.label('ArtistName')).join(models.Artist).offset(skip).limit(num).all()
```

  - Create a new file `main.py` and copy in the following code.
    - The `get_db` function handles creating and closing a new `SessionLocal` instance, or DB connection/ session, for every request.
    - A GET request to the `/albums/` endpoint calls the `read_albums` function, which returns a list of SQLAlchemy `Album` models. The `response_model` ensures only data declared in the Pydantic schema is returned to the client.
      - The `AlbumResponse` Pydantic model in `schemas.py` has `ArtistName`, as opposed to `ArtistId` defined in the `Album` SQLAlchemy model in `models.py`.
      - `read_albums` calls the `get_albums` function in `read.py`. `get_albums` queries the `Album` ORM model/ `albums` DB table for the first 20 albums, and joins the `Artist` ORM model/ `artists` DB table to retrieve the `Artist.Name` (re-labeled `ArtistName`) expected by the `AlbumResponse` Pydantic model.

```py
from .database import SessionLocal
from . import read, schemas

from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

app = FastAPI()

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@app.get("/albums/", response_model=list[schemas.AlbumResponse])
def read_albums(skip: int = 0, num: int = 20, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    albums = read.get_albums(db, skip=skip, num=num)
    return albums
```

5. **Run your FastAPI app**
  - From your `sqlalchemy-quickstart` directory, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn fastapi_sqlc_app.main:app --reload
```

  - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/albums/` to see your app data.

6. **Troubleshooting**

  - If you encounter the following error, restart your IDE and re-run your app.

```bash
AttributeError: module 'sqlitecloud.dbapi2' has no attribute 'sqlite_version_info'`
```

7. **References**

  - [FastAPI SQL Databases tutorial](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/)
  - [Latest SQLAlchemy docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/)

And that's it! You've successfully built a FastAPI app that uses SQLAlchemy ORM to read data from a SQLite Cloud database.
