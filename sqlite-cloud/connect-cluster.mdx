SQLite databases in SQLite Cloud are distributed across a cluster of nodes. Each cluster comes with a multi-region load balancer that routes traffic to the nearest appropriate node.

For this reason, we strongly recommend connecting to your cluster via your project connection string. To retrive your project connection string, navigate to the **Nodes** page and click on any node.

Copy the connection string and use it with a client library to connect to your cluster.

## Connecting with JavaScript
Here's an example of how you can connect to your cluster using the `@sqlitecloud/drivers` JavaScript client library:

First, install the client library:

```bash
npm install @sqlitecloud/drivers
```

Then, connect to your cluster using the connection string:

```javascript
import { Database } from '@sqlitecloud/drivers';

const db = new Database('sqlitecloud://<your-project-id>.sqlite.cloud:<your-host-port>?apikey=<your-api-key>')

const fetchAlbums = async () => await db.sql`USE DATABASE chinook.sqlite; SELECT * FROM albums;`;

fetchAlbums().then((albums) => console.log(albums));

// [{ Title: 'For Those About To Rock We Salute You', ... }, ...]
```

## Connecting with Python
Install the Python client library:

```bash
pip install sqlitecloud
```

Then, connect to your cluster using the connection string:

```python
import sqlitecloud

# Open the connection to SQLite Cloud
# Note: Include your target database in the url to skip the USE DATABASE command
conn = sqlitecloud.connect("sqlitecloud://<your-project-id>.sqlite.cloud:<your-host-port>?apikey=<your-api-key>")

cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM albums WHERE AlbumId = ?", (1, ))
result = cursor.fetchone()

print(result)

conn.close()

# (1, 'For Those About To Rock We Salute You', 1)
```
