In this quickstart, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud and Flask by building a simple application that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database.

---

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
  - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://sqlitecloud.io/register) and create a new project.
  - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.

2. **Create a Flask app**
  - You should have the latest Python version (3) installed locally.

```bash
mkdir sqlc-quickstart
cd sqlc-quickstart

python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate

pip install flask
```

3. **Install the SQLite Cloud SDK**

```bash
pip install sqlitecloud
```

4. **Query data**
  - Copy the following code into a new `app.py` file.
  - In your SQLite Cloud account dashboard, click on a Node, copy the Connection String, and replace `<your-connection-string>` below.

```py
from flask import Flask
import sqlitecloud

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def get_albums():
    conn = sqlitecloud.connect('<your-connection-string>')

    db_name = 'chinook.sqlite'
    db_query = "SELECT albums.AlbumId as id, albums.Title as title, artists.name as artist FROM albums INNER JOIN artists WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId LIMIT 20"

    conn.execute(f"USE DATABASE {db_name}")

    cursor = conn.execute(db_query)

    conn.close()

    result = '<div><h1>Albums</h1>'

    for row in cursor:
        album = f"{row[1]} by {row[2]}"
        result += f"<li>{album}</li>"

    return result + '</div>'
```

5. **Run your app**
  - If you're using port 5000 or on MacOS, also pass the `--port` option to provdie an open port.
  - Pass the --debug option to enable hot reloading and interactive debugging on your dev server.

```bash
flask run --port 3000 --debug
```

6. **View your app**
  - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` to see your app data.
  - If you're unfamiliar with Flask, the code above calls the `get_albums` function when you load the root URL. The function returns a string with HTML for the browser to render.

And that's it! You've successfully built a Flask app that reads data from a SQLite Cloud database.
