In this quickstart, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud and Django by building a simple application that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database.

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
  - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://sqlitecloud.io/register) and create a new database.
  - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.

2. **Create a Django app**
  - If you haven't already done so, [install Python and Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/install/).
  - The following command creates an outer directory (the container for your project) AND an inner directory (the Python package for your project). Both directories will be named `sqlitecloud_quickstart`.

```bash
django-admin startproject sqlitecloud_quickstart
```
  - The following command creates your app as a separate package within the project container directory.

```bash
cd sqlitecloud_quickstart
python manage.py startapp albums
```

3. **Install the SQLite Cloud Python SDK**
  - Run this command from your current directory (i.e. the outer `sqlitecloud_quickstart`).

```bash
pip install sqlitecloud
```

4. **App setup**
  - Create a new file `albums/services.py` and copy in the following code.
  - In your SQLite Cloud account dashboard, click on a Node, copy the Connection String, and replace `<your-connection-string>` below.

```python
import sqlitecloud

def get_albums():
  conn = sqlitecloud.connect('<your-connection-string>')

  db_name = "chinook.sqlite"
  db_query = "SELECT albums.AlbumId as id, albums.Title as title, artists.name as artist FROM albums INNER JOIN artists WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId LIMIT 20"

  conn.execute(f"USE DATABASE {db_name}")

  cursor = conn.execute(db_query)

  conn.close()

  result = cursor.fetchall()

  return result
```

  - Copy the following code into `albums/views.py`. This view function invokes the `get_albums()` function defined in `services.py` to connect to the database and return album and artist information.
  - The view function converts each returned row from a list to an object to more easily access the information in our HTML template (will discuss further later).

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template import loader
from .services import get_albums

def index(request):
  albumsList = get_albums()

  albumObjsList = [{'album': row[1], 'artist': row[2]} for row in albumsList]

  template = loader.get_template("albums/index.html")
  context = {
      "albumObjsList": albumObjsList,
  }
  return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))
```

  - Create a new file `albums/urls.py` and copy in the following code. This URL configuration (URLconf) maps the above view to a URL so we can access the view in the browser.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index")
]
```

  - Adjust the code in `sqlitecloud_quickstart/urls.py` to be as follows. We must configure this global URLconf in the inner `sqlitecloud_quickstart` to include the URLconf we defined above in our app.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

# global URLconfs
urlpatterns = [
    path("albums/", include("albums.urls")),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

  - Now we'll create a Django template the view can use to render HTML. Under `albums`, create a new file at `templates/albums/index.html` and copy in the following code.
    - Bear in mind, there are now 2 (outer and inner) `albums` directories.
    - The `index` view function above is already set up to load and render the template `albums/index.html`. (NOTE: `albums` here is the inner `albums` dir.)

```html
<div>
    <h1>Albums</h1>
    <ul>
    {% for row in albumObjsList %}
        <li>{{ row.album }} by {{ row.artist }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</div>
```
  - Lastly, in `sqlitecloud_quickstart/settings.py`, configure `DIRS` in `TEMPLATES` as follows.
    - `'APP_DIRS': True` tells Django's templating engine to look for template source files inside project apps.
    - `DIRS` provides the filepath to the correct app's `templates` dir.

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': ['albums/templates'],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

5. **Run the Django dev server**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

  - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/albums/` to see your app data.

6. **FOLLOW-UP:**
This Quickstart goes a bit deeper into the framework than the other Quickstarts since Django requires more boilerplate to get up-and-running with a simple app.

If you're new to Django and want to learn more, we referenced the following Django Tutorial pages extensively when writing this Quickstart:
  - [Part 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01)
  - [Part 3](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial03)

And that's it! You've successfully built a Django app that reads data from a SQLite Cloud database.
