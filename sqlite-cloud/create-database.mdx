Create a new database in SQLite Cloud by importing an existing SQLite database, or using the SQLite Cloud UI, API, or client libraries.

## Importing an existing SQLite database
SQLite Cloud allows you to import existing SQLite databases into the platform. 

Note that you can download, modify, and re-upload the database file at any time. You can also upload encrypted SQLite databases if you used the official SEE SQLite encryption extension.

To import a database from the UI, navigate to the Databases tab and click the "Upload Database" button.

Select the database file you want to upload, and click "Upload Database". The database will be available in your cluster within a few minutes.

The default encoding is set to UTF-8, and the default page size is 4096KB.

### From the API
To create a new database or upload an existing database via [Weblite](#), our REST API, you can make a request with the following parameters:
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://<your-project-id>.sqlite.cloud:8090/v2/weblite/<database-name>.sqlite' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sqlitecloud://<your-project-id>.sqlite.cloud:8860?apikey=<your-api-key>' \
  -d ''
```

### From client libraries
To create a new database from a client library, use the CREATE DATABASE command. 

```javascript
import { Database } from '@sqlitecloud/drivers';

const db = new Database('sqlitecloud://<your-project-id>.sqlite.cloud:<your-host-port>?apikey=<your-api-key>')

const createDatabase = async () => await db.sql`CREATE DATABASE <database-name>;`;

createDatabase().then((res) => console.log(res));

// "OK"
```
