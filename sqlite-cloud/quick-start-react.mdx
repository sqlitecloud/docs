In this quickstart, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud and React by building a simple application that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database.

---

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
   - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://sqlitecloud.io/register) and create a new project.
   - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.
2. **Create a React app**
   - Create a React app using a Vite template
```bash
npm create vite@latest sqlc-quickstart -- --template react
```
3. **Install the SQLite Cloud SDK**
```bash
cd sqlc-quickstart && npm install @sqlitecloud/drivers
```
4. **Query data**
    - Grab a connection string by clicking on a node in your dashboard.
    - Use the following code to display data from your database.
  ```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Database } from '@sqlitecloud/drivers';

const db = new Database('<your-connection-string>');

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  const getAlbums = async () => {
    const result = await db.sql`
    USE DATABASE chinook.sqlite; 
    SELECT albums.AlbumId as id, albums.Title as title, artists.name as artist
    FROM albums 
    INNER JOIN artists 
    WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
    LIMIT 20;`;
    setData(result);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getAlbums();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Albums</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map((album) => (
          <li key={album.id}>{album.title} by {album.artist}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App
```
5. **Run your app**
```bash
npm run dev
```
6. **View your app**
   - Open your browser and navigate to the localhost link provided by the previous command to see your app data.

And that's it! You've successfully built a React app that reads data from a SQLite Cloud database.
