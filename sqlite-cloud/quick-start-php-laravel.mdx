In this quickstart, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud and PHP by building a simple Laravel application that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database.

---

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
  - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://sqlitecloud.io/register) and create a new database.
  - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.

2. **Create a Laravel app**
  - If you haven't already done so, install PHP, Laravel, and Composer.
    - If you use macOS, you can install all 3 in 1 click by [downloading Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/1/getting-started/installation#installation), a PHP dev environment.
  - Create a new Laravel project.

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel sqlc-quickstart
```

  - In the project directory, start Laravel's local dev server.

```bash
cd sqlc-quickstart
php artisan serve
```

  - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see your Laravel app.

3. **Configure a Blade frontend**
  - Open another terminal. Again in your project dir, install Laravel Breeze.
    - By default, Breeze uses simple Blade templates for your app's view layer. Blade is a templating engine included with Laravel. HTML is rendered server-side so you can include dynamic content from your database.

```bash
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
php artisan breeze:install blade
```

  - Start a Vite dev server that will hot reload updates to your app. (No need to load the provided localhost link, just keep the Vite server running.)

```bash
npm run dev
```

  - Refresh your app in the browser. Click the "Register" link at the top right. Register an account and log in. Save your credentials.

4. **App setup**

  - Open another terminal. Again in your project dir, run `php artisan make:model -rc Album` to create an Eloquent Model (which we'll ignore) and a HTTP resource controller: `app/Http/Controllers/AlbumController.php`. We'll add functionality to this file to process app requests and return responses later.
  - Replace the code in `routes/web.php` with the following snippet to add a route named `albums.index`.
    - Run `php artisan route:list` to view all your app routes.
    - `albums.index` will route GET requests to the `albums` endpoint to `AlbumController`'s `index` method (will set up later).

```php
<?php

use App\Http\Controllers\AlbumController;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::resource('albums', AlbumController::class)
    ->only(['index']);
```

  - Create a new file `resources/views/albums/index.blade.php` and copy in the following code to create your Blade view template.

```php
<h1>Albums</h1>
<ul>
@foreach ($albums as $album)
    <li>{{ $album['albumTitle'] }} by {{ $album['artistName'] }}</li>
@endforeach
</ul>
```

5. **Install the SQLite Cloud SDK**

```bash
composer require sqlitecloud/sqlitecloud
```

6. **Query data**

  - Replace the code in `app/Http/Controllers/AlbumController.php` with the following snippet.
  - In your SQLite Cloud account dashboard, click on a Node, copy the Connection String, and replace `<your-connection-string>` below.
  - The `index` method will:
    - connect to and query the database,
    - create an array of arrays `albums` containing each returned album's title and artist,
    - use the global `view` helper to pass `albums` to your view template stored at `resources/views/albums/index.blade.php` (and already set up to list the data), and
    - return the completed Blade view to the browser.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\View\View;
use SQLiteCloud\SQLiteCloudClient;
use SQLiteCloud\SQLiteCloudRowset;

class AlbumController extends Controller
{
    public function index(): View
    {
        $sqlite = new SQLiteCloudClient();
        $sqlite->connectWithString('<your-connection-string>');

        $db_name = 'chinook.sqlite';
        $db_query = 'SELECT albums.AlbumId as id, albums.Title as title, artists.name as artist FROM albums INNER JOIN artists WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId LIMIT 20';

        $sqlite->execute("USE DATABASE {$db_name}");
        
        $rowset = $sqlite->execute($db_query);

        $sqlite->disconnect();

        $albums = [];

        for($i = 0; $i < $rowset->nrows; $i++) {
            $albums[] = [
                'albumTitle' => $rowset->value($i, 1),
                'artistName' => $rowset->value($i, 2),
            ];
        }
        
        return view('albums.index', [ 
            'albums' => $albums
        ]);
    }
}
```

7. **View your app**
  - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/albums` to see your app data.

8. **FOLLOW-UP:**
This Quickstart goes a bit deeper into the framework than the other Quickstarts since Laravel requires more boilerplate to get up-and-running with a simple app.

If you're new to Laravel and want to learn more, we referenced the following Laravel Tutorial pages extensively when writing this Quickstart:
  - [Installation](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/blade/installation)
  - [Controllers, Routing, Blade](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/blade/creating-chirps)

And that's it! You've successfully built a PHP / Laravel app that reads data from a SQLite Cloud database.
