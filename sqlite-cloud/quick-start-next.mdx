In this quickstart, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud and Next.js by building a simple application that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database.

---

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
   - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://dashboard.sqlitecloud.io/auth/sign-in) and create a new project.
   - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.
2. **Create a Next.js app**
   - Create a Next app using ```create-next-app```. The following command creates a very simple app (JS, no Tailwind, uses the latest App Router) to keep the focus on querying the data. 
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest sqlc-quickstart --js --no-tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --use-npm
```
3. **Install the SQLite Cloud SDK**
```bash
cd sqlc-quickstart && npm install @sqlitecloud/drivers
```
4. **Query data**
    - Replace the code in ```layout.js``` and ```page.js``` with the following snippets.
    - Click a node in your account dashboard and copy the connection string. Replace ```<your-connection-string>``` in ```page.js``` with your connection string.

In ```src/app/layout.js```:
```jsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Create Next App',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

In ```src/app/page.js```:
```jsx
import { Database } from '@sqlitecloud/drivers';

async function getAlbums() {
  const db = new Database('<your-connection-string>');

  const result = await db.sql`USE DATABASE chinook.sqlite; 
  SELECT albums.AlbumId as id, albums.Title as title, artists.name as artist
  FROM albums 
  INNER JOIN artists 
  WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
  LIMIT 20;`;

  return result;
}

export default async function Home() {
  const res = await getAlbums();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Albums</h1>
      <ul>
        {res.map(({ id, title, artist }) => (
          <li key={id}>
            {title} by {artist}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

5. **Run your app**
```bash
npm run dev
```
6. **View your app**
   - Open your browser and navigate to the localhost link provided by the previous command to see your app data.

And that's it! You've successfully built a Next app that reads data from a SQLite Cloud database.
