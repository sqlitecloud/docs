In this quickstart, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud and Node.js by building a simple web server that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database, then serves that data to the client.

---

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
   - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://dashboard.sqlitecloud.io/auth/sign-in) and create a new project.
   - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.
2. **Create a Node.js app**
   - Navigate to your target directory and run the following command to initialize your Node.js app and install the necessary depedencies:
```bash
npm init
``` 
  - After creating your project, install the SQLite Cloud SDK:
```bash
npm install express @sqlitecloud/drivers --save
```
  - Create a file named `index.js` in the root directory of your project.

3. **Query data**
    - Grab a connection string by clicking on a node in your dashboard.
    - Paste the following into your `index.js` file:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const { Database } = require("@sqlitecloud/drivers");

const app = express();
let db;

function getDatabase() {
  if (!db || !db.isConnected()) {
    db = new Database("<connection-string>", (error) => {
      if (error) {
        console.log("Error during the connection", error);
      } else {
        console.log("Connected to the database");
      }
    });
  }

  return db;
}

app.get("/albums", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const result = await getDatabase().sql(`
            USE DATABASE chinook.sqlite; 
            SELECT albums.AlbumId as id, albums.Title as title, artists.name as artist
            FROM albums 
            INNER JOIN artists 
            WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
            LIMIT 20;`);
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```
5. **Run your app**
```bash
node index.js
```
6. **View your web server response**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/albums` to see your app in action.

And that's it! You've successfully built a Node.js app that reads and serves data from a SQLite Cloud database.
