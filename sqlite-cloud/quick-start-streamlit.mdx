In this quickstart, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud and Streamlit by building a simple application that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database.

---

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
  - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://dashboard.sqlitecloud.io/auth/sign-in) and create a new project.
  - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.

2. **Create a Streamlit app**
  - You should have the latest Python version (3) installed locally.

```bash
mkdir sqlc-quickstart
cd sqlc-quickstart

python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate

pip install streamlit
```

3. **Install the SQLite Cloud SDK**

```bash
pip install sqlitecloud
```

4. **Query data**
  - Copy the following code into a new `app.py` file.
  - In your SQLite Cloud account dashboard, click your Project name, copy the Connection String, and replace `<your-connection-string>` below.

```py
import streamlit as st
import sqlitecloud
import pandas as pd

st.header('Invoices')

conn = sqlitecloud.connect('<your-connection-string>')

db_name = "chinook.sqlite"
conn.execute(f"USE DATABASE {db_name}")

invoices = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM invoices LIMIT 20", conn)

st.dataframe(invoices, hide_index=True)
```

5. **Run your app**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

6. **View your app**
  - Open your browser and navigate to the localhost link provided by the previous command to see your app data.

And that's it! You've successfully built a Streamlit app that reads data from a SQLite Cloud database.
