## Overview
Backups provide a robust solution for mitigating data loss and resolving data corruption issues. Backups are available for databases in all [Pro and Scale](https://www.sqlitecloud.io/pricing) projects.

SQLite Cloud creates a full snapshot backup of your data once a day, and stores incremental changes once per second, on commodity object storage.

## Features

#### Automated Backups
- **Full Database Snapshots**: Automatically captures a full snapshot of the database at least once every retention period (default 24 hours), ensuring you always have a recent backup.
- **Incremental Updates**: Captures changes to the database at a frequency of once per second, provided there are modifications.
- **Continuous Data Protection**: Stores incremental updates alongside full snapshots, allowing for recovery to any specific second within the retention period.
- **Easy Restoration Process**: Restoring from a backup automatically overwrites the existing database, seamlessly reverting it to the desired state without additional configuration.
- **Consistency and Reliability**: After restoration, the database functions as it did at the chosen point in time, ensuring operational continuity.
