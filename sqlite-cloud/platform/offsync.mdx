Offsync is a powerful SQLite Cloud feature that enables true **local-first** data synchronization for your applications. Powered by the [SQLite Sync](https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-sync) extension, it allows you to build robust, offline-capable applications where data is stored and processed on edge devices and seamlessly synchronized with a central SQLite Cloud database.

This architecture is ideal for mobile apps, IoT devices, and any application requiring high availability and low latency, even with intermittent network connectivity. By leveraging Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), Offsync ensures that changes made offline are merged automatically and without conflicts when the device reconnects.

## How It Works

Offsync extends standard SQLite tables with built-in support for offline work and automatic synchronization. This allows multiple devices to operate independently and then seamlessly merge their changes.

- **Offline-First by Design**: Applications work seamlessly even when devices are offline. Changes are queued locally and synced automatically when connectivity is restored.
- **CRDT-Based Conflict Resolution**: Merges updates deterministically and efficiently, ensuring eventual consistency across all replicas without complex merge logic.
- **Seamless Integration**: The sync layer is tightly integrated with SQLite Cloud, enabling secure data sharing across devices, users, and platforms.

When combined with [Row-Level Security (RLS)](/docs/rls), Offsync allows you to build secure, multi-tenant applications where each user's data is safely isolated, both on the edge and in the cloud.

## Configuring Offsync

You can enable and manage Offsync for your databases directly from the SQLite Cloud dashboard.

1.  **Navigate to the Databases Page**: From the main dashboard, go to the "Databases" page.
2.  **Select the Offsync Column**: In the list of your databases, click on the button in the "Offsync" column for the desired database.

3.  **Enable Tables for Synchronization**: On the Offsync settings page, you will see a list of all tables in your database. Toggle the switch next to each table you want to enable for synchronization.

<Callout type="note" title="Matching Schemas and Tables">
For Offsync to work correctly, the list of tables configured for synchronization—and their corresponding schemas—must be identical in both your local SQLite database and your SQLite Cloud database.

Once enabled, any changes made to the selected tables via the SQLite Sync extension will be automatically synchronized with your SQLite Cloud database.
