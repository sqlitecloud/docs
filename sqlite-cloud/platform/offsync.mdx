OffSync is a powerful SQLite Cloud feature that enables true **local-first** data synchronization for your applications. Powered by the <a href="https://github.com/sqliteai/sqlite-sync" target="_blank">SQLite Sync</a> extension, it allows you to build robust, offline-capable applications where data is stored and processed on edge devices and seamlessly synchronized with a central SQLite Cloud database.

This architecture is ideal for mobile apps, IoT devices, and any application requiring high availability and low latency, even with intermittent network connectivity. By leveraging Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), OffSync ensures that changes made offline are merged automatically and without conflicts when the device reconnects.

## How It Works

OffSync extends standard SQLite tables with built-in support for offline work and automatic synchronization. This allows multiple devices to operate independently and then seamlessly merge their changes.

- **Offline-First by Design**: Applications work seamlessly even when devices are offline. Changes are queued locally and synced automatically when connectivity is restored.
- **CRDT-Based Conflict Resolution**: Merges updates deterministically and efficiently, ensuring eventual consistency across all replicas without complex merge logic.
- **Seamless Integration**: The sync layer is tightly integrated with SQLite Cloud, enabling secure data sharing across devices, users, and platforms.

When combined with [Row-Level Security (RLS)](/docs/rls), OffSync allows you to build secure, multi-tenant applications where each user's data is safely isolated, both on the edge and in the cloud.

## Configuring OffSync

You can enable and manage OffSync for your databases directly from the SQLite Cloud dashboard.  
Below are the main steps:

### Enable Tables for Synchronization
From the **Sync Tables** tab, select which tables in your database you want to keep synchronized.  
Once enabled, all changes to those tables will automatically sync with connected devices.

<VideoPlayer src={enableSync} />


### Get the Connection String
In the **Configuration** tab, copy the connection string.  
Use this in your application to initialize OffSync and connect your local SQLite database with SQLite Cloud.

<VideoPlayer src={connectionUrlSync} />


### Manage Connected Devices
In the **Devices** tab, you can view all devices currently connected to your database.  
Here you can check their sync status and remove devices if needed.

<VideoPlayer src={devicesSync} />

<Callout type="note" title="Matching Schemas and Tables">
For OffSync to work correctly, the list of tables configured for synchronization—and their corresponding schemas—must be identical in both your local SQLite database and your SQLite Cloud database.
</Callout>

Once enabled, any changes made to the selected tables via the SQLite Sync extension will be automatically synchronized with your SQLite Cloud database.
