## Common Use Cases

### Debugging Errors

When troubleshooting issues, filter logs by ERROR level and the relevant time period to quickly identify problems. For example, database constraint violations, connection issues, or query errors will appear in the logs with detailed error messages.

### Monitoring Activity

Track client connections, query executions, and system events by reviewing logs across different log types and sources. This helps you understand usage patterns and system behavior.

### Performance Analysis

Review logs during specific time periods to correlate events with performance issues or unexpected behavior in your application.
