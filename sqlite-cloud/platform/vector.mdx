Every SQLite Cloud database comes with the `sqlite-vec` extension pre-installed. This allows you to store and query vectors in your database, which enables similarity search functionality.

## Overview
`sqlite-vec` is a no-dependency SQLite extension for vector search, written entirely in a single C file. It's extremely portable, works in most operating systems and environments, and is MIT/Apache-2 dual licensed.

Using sqlite-vec is similar to using full-text search in SQLite. Declare a "virtual table" with vector columns, insert data with normal INSERT INTO statements, and query with normal SELECT statements.

`sqlite-vec` is currently built and optimized for brute-force vector search. This means there is no approximate nearest neighbor search available, limiting the number of vectors that can be searched in a reasonable amount of time.

## Usage
### Create a vector table

To create a virtual vector table, use vec0 and the following syntax:

```sql
create virtual table vec_table_name using vec0(
  id integer primary key autoincrement,
  embedding float[384]
--   other columns like:
--   text text,
--   metadata blob,
);
```

### Insert vectors
Insert vectors as you would with any other data:

```sql
insert into vec_table_name(embedding) values
   ('[0.1, 0.2, ...]'),
   ('[0.3, 0.4, ...]'),
   ('[0.5, 0.6, ...]');
```
### Execute a similarity search query
To search for similar vectors, use the following syntax:

```sql
select
	rowid,
	distance
from vec_table_name
where embedding match <your query embedding>
  and k = 20;
```

The value of k sets the number of nearest neighbors to return. For more on nearest neighbor searches, check out our article on the topic.

## Quantization
Vector quantization is a category of techniques to compress the individual elements inside of a floating point vector. In a float vector, each element is stored as a 32-bit floating point number. For longer vectors, this will quickly require a large amount of storage.

To reduce storage requirements with minimal loss of accuracy, we recommend using bit vectors as a method of quantization. With bit vector, each dimension in the vector takes up 1 bit. This method delivers up to a 32x reduction in storage requirements.

When using bit vectors, we recommend using embedding models that are trained on binary quantization loss. This will help maintain accuracy even after converting to binary.

To convert a float vector to a binary vector, use the vec_quantize_binary() function:

```sql
create virtual table vec_table using vec0(
  embedding float[1536]
);

-- slim because "embedding_coarse" is quantized 32x to a bit vector
create virtual table vec_table_slim using vec0(
  embedding_coarse bit[1536]
);

insert into vec_table_slim
  select rowid, vec_quantize_binary(embedding) from vec_table;
```
## Matryoshka embeddings
sqlite-vec also supports Matryoshka embeddings, a technique in some embeddings models that allows you to "truncate" excess dimensions of a given vector, without a significant loss in quality. 

Matryoshka embedding save on storage and result in faster queries.

To create a Matryoshka embedding, use the vec_slice() function:

```sql

create virtual table vec_items using vec0(
  embedding float[1536]
);

-- slim because "embedding" is a truncated version of the full vector
create virtual table vec_items_slim using vec0(
  embedding_coarse float[512]
);

insert into vec_items_slim
  select
    rowid,
    vec_normalize(vec_slice(embedding, 0, 512))
  from vec_items;
```

## Performance considerations
Free SQLite Cloud plans are not optimized for vector workloads. To speak to the team about upgrading your plan, [please reach out](https://www.sqlitecloud.io/support).

## Next Steps
Combined with [edge functions](/docs/edge-functions), SQLite Cloud's vector search capabilities make it a great choice for serverless RAG applications.
