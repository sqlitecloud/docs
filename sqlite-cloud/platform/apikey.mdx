API KEYs can be used as an alternative authentication mechanism.
Authentication through API keys ensures the same privileges as the user to which they are associated.
API KEYs are recommended for all server-to-server authentication cases and are necessary for using the REST APIs and the SDKs that uses the WebSocket APIs.

You can manage all keys in your cluster via the SQLite Cloud Dashboard under the **API Keys** section.

## Creating an API Key

You can create an API Key and immediately assign it to any existing user in your cluster.

1. Navigate to the **API Keys** section in the left sidebar.
2. Click the **Create API Key** button.
3. **API Key Name:** Enter a descriptive name to identify the key (e.g., `MobileApp_Prod`, `Backend_Worker`).
4. **User:** Select the user this key will impersonate from the dropdown list.
5. **Expiration:**
    *   Select **Never expires** for long-running services.
    *   Select **Set expiration date** to enforce a rotation policy or for temporary access tokens.
6. Click **Create**.

## Managing API Keys

The API Keys list provides a centralized view of all active keys, their associated users, and expiration status.

### Regenerating a Key
If a key is lost, forgotten, or you suspect it has been compromised (leaked), you should regenerate it immediately.

1. Find the key in the list.
2. Click the context menu (three dots) on the right.
3. Select **Regenerate**.
4. Confirm the action in the modal window.

**Warning:** Regenerating a key invalidates the old key string immediately. You must update any applications or scripts using the old key with the new value to restore connectivity.

### Editing and Deleting
*   **Edit:** Allows you to rename the key or change its expiration settings without changing the key string itself.
*   **Delete:** Permanently revokes the key. Applications using this key will no longer be able to connect.

## Using API Keys

Once generated, the API Key is typically used in the connection string of your SQLite Cloud client or SDK.

The standard format for a connection string using an API Key is:
```
sqlitecloud://<host>:<port>?apikey=<your-api-key>
```

When using the REST API directly, the key should be passed in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```
