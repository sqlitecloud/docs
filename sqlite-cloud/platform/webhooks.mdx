Webhooks in SQLite Cloud are a powerful way to receive and send event-based notifications.

## Change Data Capture
With change data webhooks, you can send notifications from SQLite Cloud to any HTTP endpoint when an insert, update or delete operation occurs on a specified database and/or table. The webhook payload includes the database name, table name, and the row data that was changed.

## Trigger Edge Functions
Webhooks can also be used to trigger your edge functions, either via HTTP or Websockets request, or on a database event.
