This powerful package provides methods that perform DB operations, and enables real-time notifications in Swift apps, making it easier than ever to work with SQLite in the cloud. We encourage all users to log encountered issues in the [SDK's issues backlog](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sqlitecloud-swift/issues).

## Install

  - In `Package.swift`, add the `swift` package to `dependencies`.

```swift
let package = Package(
  ...,
  dependencies: [
    ...,
    .package(url: "https://github.com/sqlitecloud/swift.git", from: "0.2.1")
  ],
  ...
)
```

## 3 ways to configure your database connection

1. **RECOMMENDED**: Use the `apikey` connection string.

  - In your SQLite Cloud account dashboard, click on `Show connection strings`, copy the Connection String, and replace `<your-connection-string>` below.

```swift
let configuration = SQLiteCloudConfig(connectionString: "<your-connection-string>")
```

  - You can modify the connection string to include the name of the database to query.

```swift
let configuration = SQLiteCloudConfig(connectionString: "sqlitecloud://{hostname}:8860/{database}?apikey={apikey}")
``` 

2. Use a parameterized connection string.

    - In your SQLite Cloud account dashboard, click on `Show connection strings`, copy the Deployment string, and replace `{hostname}` below.
    - In your dashboard left nav, select Settings, then Users. Copy your username and replace `{username}`.
    - In your User's row, click the down chevron, then Edit. Enter a Password and Save. Replace `{password}`.
    - Here, the provided port (`8860`) and database (`chinook.sqlite`) will query the sample dataset that comes pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud. Replace to query your own datasets.

```swift
let configuration = SQLiteCloudConfig(connectionString: "sqlitecloud://{username}:{password}@{hostname}:8860/chinook.sqlite")
```
    
3. Pass each connection string parameter explicitly.

```swift
let configuration = SQLiteCloudConfig(hostname: {hostname}, username: {username}, password: {password}, port: .default)
```

## Connect and query

  - The following snippet includes variable types, which may be optional for your app.
  - NOTE: `USE DATABASE chinook.sqlite;` is only necessary in the query if your `configuration` does not specify the name of the database to query.
  - Once you've incorporated the following, build and run your app!

```swift
import SQLiteCloud

let configuration: SQLiteCloudConfig? = SQLiteCloudConfig(connectionString: "<your-connection-string>")

let sqliteCloud: SQLiteCloud = SQLiteCloud(config: configuration!)

do {
    try await sqliteCloud.connect()
    debugPrint("connected")

    let sqlQuery: String = "USE DATABASE chinook.sqlite; SELECT albums.AlbumId as id, albums.Title as title, artists.name as artist FROM albums INNER JOIN artists WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId LIMIT 20;"

    let result: SQLiteCloudResult = try await sqliteCloud.execute(query: sqlQuery)

    try await sqliteCloud.disconnect()

    return result.stringValue!
} catch {
    return "Connection error"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

  - If you get errors indicating SQLite Cloud-specific constructs are out of scope (i.e. `error: cannot find 'SQLiteCloudConfig' in scope`), verify the `SQLiteCloud` package is correctly imported.
    - Confirm `https://github.com/sqlitecloud/swift` package is listed in `Package.resolved`.
