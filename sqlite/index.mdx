Welcome to our interactive SQLite documentation, where we bring learning to life with an innovative and interactive feature.
This powerful tool empowers users to test SQL queries in real time within the context of our documentation, providing a hands-on and immersive learning experience.

Thanks to WASM a local SQLite database with two tables is available to test your SQL queries:

<pre>
CREATE TABLE Album (AlbumId INTEGER  NOT NULL, Title TEXT  NOT NULL, ArtistId INTEGER  NOT NULL);
CREATE TABLE Artist (ArtistId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Name TEXT);
</pre>

The Album table is pre-filled with 347 rows, while the Artist table contains 275 entries.

You can execute any SQLite statement by pressing the `Run` button.
All the changes will be saved locally to your private database copy.
You can reset the database to its default values at any time by pressing the `Reset database` button.

**Key Features:**

1. **Locally Imported SQLite WASM Database:** We've seamlessly integrated a SQLite WebAssembly (WASM) database directly into our documentation environment, ensuring a fast and responsive experience for users.
2. **Interactive Console on Every Page:** Each page of our documentation now features a dedicated console, allowing users to execute and experiment with SQL queries right where they are learning.
3. **Real-Time Query Testing:** Experience the power of testing your queries instantly. As you type, the console dynamically processes your SQL statements against the imported SQLite database, providing immediate feedback.
4. **Enhanced Learning Experience:** Gain a deeper understanding of SQLite concepts by applying them in real scenarios. The interactive console bridges the gap between theory and practice, reinforcing your knowledge through hands-on exploration.
5. **Safe Testing Environment:** Don't worry about accidentally modifying or damaging your own database. The console operates in a controlled environment, ensuring that your experimentation stays confined to the documentation platform.
6. **Example Queries and Snippets:** To assist users in getting started, we provide a library of example queries and code snippets. Copy, paste, and modify these examples to suit your learning needs.
7. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Receive detailed error messages and explanations in case of query issues. This helps users understand and learn from mistakes, turning errors into valuable learning opportunities.
8. **Responsive Design:** Whether you're accessing our documentation on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, the interactive console adapts to your screen size, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience.

Unlock the full potential of SQLite with our innovative documentation featuring the Interactive SQLite Console. Elevate your learning journey by actively engaging with SQL queries, and transform theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Dive in, explore, and master SQLite with confidence!
