## 1. Overview

<!-- do-not-touch-svg-import: 'with.svg' -->

Common Table Expressions or CTEs act like temporary
[views](lang_createview) that exist only for the duration of a single
SQL statement. There are two kinds of common table expressions:
"ordinary" and "recursive". Ordinary common table expressions are
helpful for making queries easier to understand by factoring subqueries
out of the main SQL statement. Recursive common table expressions
provide the ability to do hierarchical or recursive queries of trees and
graphs, a capability that is not otherwise available in the SQL
language.

All common table expressions (ordinary and recursive) are created by
prepending a WITH clause in front of a [SELECT](lang_select),
[INSERT](lang_insert), [DELETE](lang_delete), or [UPDATE](lang_update)
statement. A single WITH clause can specify one or more common table
expressions, some of which are ordinary and some of which are recursive.

## 2. Ordinary Common Table Expressions

An ordinary common table expression works as if it were a
[view](lang_createview) that exists for the duration of a single
statement. Ordinary common table expressions are useful for factoring
out subqueries and making the overall SQL statement easier to read and
understand.

A WITH clause can contain ordinary common table expressions even if it
includes the RECURSIVE keyword. The use of RECURSIVE does not force
common table expressions to be recursive.

## 3. Recursive Common Table Expressions

A recursive common table expression can be used to write a query that
walks a tree or graph. A recursive common table expression has the same
basic syntax as an ordinary common table expression, but with the
following additional attributes:

1.  The "<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/select-stmt.html"
    target="_blank">select-stmt</a>" must be a [compound
    select](lang_select#compound). That is to say, the CTE body must be
    two or more individual SELECT statements separated by compound
    operators like UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT.
2.  One or more of the individual SELECT statements that make up the
    compound must be "recursive". A SELECT statement is a recursive if
    its FROM clause contains exactly one reference to the the CTE table
    (the table named on the left-hand side of the AS clause).
3.  One or more of the SELECT statements in the compound must be
    non-recursive.
4.  All non-recursive SELECT statements must occur before any recursive
    SELECT statements.
5.  The recursive SELECT statements must be separated from the
    non-recursive SELECT statements and from each other by the UNION or
    UNION ALL operators. If there are two or more recursive SELECT
    statements, they all must be separated from each other using the
    same operator that separates the first recursive SELECT from the
    last non-recursive SELECT statement.
6.  Recursive SELECT statements may not use [aggregate
    functions](lang_aggfunc) or
    <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html"
    target="_blank">window functions</a>.

To put it another way, a recursive common table expression must look
something like the following:

<!-- do-not-touch-svg-import: 'with2.svg' -->

In the diagram above, <span class="yyterm">initial-select</span> means
one or more non-recursive SELECT statements and
<span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> means one or more recursive
SELECT statements. The most common case is for there to be exactly one
<span class="yyterm">initial-select</span> and exactly one
<span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> but more than one of each
is allowed.

Call the table named by the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/cte-table-name.html"
target="_blank">cte-table-name</a> in a recursive common table
expression the "recursive table". In the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/recursive-cte.html"
target="_blank">recursive-cte</a> bubble diagram above, the recursive
table must appear exactly once in the FROM clause of each top-level
SELECT statement in the <span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> and
must not appear anywhere else in either the
<span class="yyterm">initial-select</span> or the
<span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span>, including subqueries. The
<span class="yyterm">initial-select</span> may be a [compound
select](lang_select#compound), but it may not include an ORDER BY,
LIMIT, or OFFSET. The <span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> may
also be a [compound select](lang_select#compound) with the restriction
that all elements of that compound must be separated by the same UNION
or UNION ALL operator that separates
<span class="yyterm">initial-select</span> from
<span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span>. The
<span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> is allowed to include an
ORDER BY, LIMIT, and/or OFFSET but may not use [aggregate
functions](lang_aggfunc) or
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html"
target="_blank">window functions</a>.

The ability for the <span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> to be a
compound was added in
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_34_0.html"
target="_blank">version 3.34.0</a> (2020-12-01). In earlier versions of
SQLite, the <span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> could only be a
single simple SELECT statement.

The basic algorithm for computing the content of the recursive table is
as follows:

1.  Run the <span class="yyterm">initial-select</span> and add the
    results to a queue.
2.  While the queue is not empty:
    1.  Extract a single row from the queue.
    2.  Insert that single row into the recursive table
    3.  Pretend that the single row just extracted is the only row in
        the recursive table and run the recursive-select, adding all
        results to the queue.

The basic procedure above may modified by the following additional
rules:

- If a UNION operator connects the
  <span class="yyterm">initial-select</span> with the
  <span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span>, then only add rows to
  the queue if no identical row has been previously added to the queue.
  Repeated rows are discarded before being added to the queue even if
  the repeated rows have already been extracted from the queue by the
  recursion step. If the operator is UNION ALL, then all rows generated
  by both the <span class="yyterm">initial-select</span> and the
  <span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> are always added to the
  queue even if they are repeats. When determining if a row is repeated,
  NULL values compare equal to one another and not equal to any other
  value.

- The LIMIT clause, if present, determines the maximum number of rows
  that will ever be added to the recursive table in step 2b. Once the
  limit is reached, the recursion stops. A limit of zero means that no
  rows are ever added to the recursive table, and a negative limit means
  an unlimited number of rows may be added to the recursive table.

- The OFFSET clause, if it is present and has a positive value N,
  prevents the first N rows from being added to the recursive table. The
  first N rows are still processed by the
  <span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> — they just are not added
  to the recursive table. Rows are not counted toward fulfilling the
  LIMIT until all OFFSET rows have been skipped.

- If an ORDER BY clause is present, it determines the order in which
  rows are extracted from the queue in step 2a. If there is no ORDER BY
  clause, then the order in which rows are extracted is undefined. (In
  the current implementation, the queue becomes a FIFO if the ORDER BY
  clause is omitted, but applications should not depend on that fact
  since it might change.)

## 3.1. Recursive Query Examples

The following query returns all integers between 1 and 1000000:

>     WITH RECURSIVE
>       cnt(x) AS (VALUES(1) UNION ALL SELECT x+1 FROM cnt WHERE x<1000000)
>     SELECT x FROM cnt;

Consider how this query works. The initial-select runs first and returns
a single row with a single column "1". This one row is added to the
queue. In step 2a, that one row is extracted from the queue and added to
"cnt". Then the recursive-select is run in accordance with step 2c
generating a single new row with value "2" to add to the queue. The
queue still has one row, so step 2 repeats. The "2" row is extracted and
added to the recursive table by steps 2a and 2b. Then the row containing
2 is used as if it were the complete content of the recursive table and
the recursive-select is run again, resulting in a row with value "3"
being added to the queue. This repeats 999999 times until finally at
step 2a the only value on the queue is a row containing 1000000. That
row is extracted and added to the recursive table. But this time, the
WHERE clause causes the recursive-select to return no rows, so the queue
remains empty and the recursion stops.

**Optimization note:** In the discussion above, statements like "insert
the row into the recursive table" should be understood conceptually, not
literally. It sounds as if SQLite is accumulating a huge table
containing one million rows, then going back and scanning that table
from top to bottom to generate the result. What really happens is that
the query optimizer sees that values in the "cnt" recursive table are
only used once. So as each row is added to the recursive table, that row
is immediately returned as a result of the main SELECT statement and
then discarded. SQLite does *not* accumulate a temporary table
containing a million rows. Very little memory is needed to run the above
example. However, if the example had used UNION instead of UNION ALL,
then SQLite would have had to keep around all previously generated
content in order to check for duplicates. For this reason, programmers
should strive to use UNION ALL instead of UNION when feasible.

Here is a variation on the previous example:

>     WITH RECURSIVE
>       cnt(x) AS (
>          SELECT 1
>          UNION ALL
>          SELECT x+1 FROM cnt
>           LIMIT 1000000
>       )
>     SELECT x FROM cnt;

There are two differences in this variation. The initial-select is
"SELECT 1" instead of "VALUES(1)". But those are just different syntaxes
for saying exactly the same thing. The other change is that the
recursion is stopped by a LIMIT rather than a WHERE clause. The use of
LIMIT means that when the one-millionth row is added to the "cnt" table
(and returned by the main SELECT, thanks to the query optimizer) then
the recursion stops immediately regardless of how many rows might be
left in the queue. On more complex queries, it can sometimes be
difficult to ensure that the WHERE clause will eventually cause the
queue to drain and the recursion to terminate. But the LIMIT clause will
always stop the recursion. So it is good practice to always include a
LIMIT clause as a safety if an upper bound on the size of the recursion
is known. <span id="rcex2"></span>

## 3.2. Hierarchical Query Examples

Consider a table that describes the members of an organization as well
as the chain-of-command within that organization:

>     CREATE TABLE org(
>       name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
>       boss TEXT REFERENCES org,
>       height INT,
>       -- other content omitted
>     );

Every member in the organization has a name, and most members have a
single boss. (The head of the whole organization has a NULL "boss"
field.) The rows of the "org" table form a tree.

Here is a query that computes the average height over everyone in
Alice's organization, including Alice:

>     WITH RECURSIVE
>       works_for_alice(n) AS (
>         VALUES('Alice')
>         UNION
>         SELECT name FROM org, works_for_alice
>          WHERE org.boss=works_for_alice.n
>       )
>     SELECT avg(height) FROM org
>      WHERE org.name IN works_for_alice;

The next example uses two common table expressions in a single WITH
clause. The following table records a family tree:

>     CREATE TABLE family(
>       name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
>       mom TEXT REFERENCES family,
>       dad TEXT REFERENCES family,
>       born DATETIME,
>       died DATETIME -- NULL if still alive
>       -- other content
>     );

The "family" table is similar to the earlier "org" table except that now
there are two parents to each member. We want to know all living
ancestors of Alice, from oldest to youngest. An ordinary common table
expression, "parent_of", is defined first. That ordinary CTE is a view
that can be used to find all parents of any individual. That ordinary
CTE is then used in the "ancestor_of_alice" recursive CTE. The recursive
CTE is then used in the final query:

>     WITH RECURSIVE
>       parent_of(name, parent) AS
>         (SELECT name, mom FROM family UNION SELECT name, dad FROM family),
>       ancestor_of_alice(name) AS
>         (SELECT parent FROM parent_of WHERE name='Alice'
>          UNION ALL
>          SELECT parent FROM parent_of JOIN ancestor_of_alice USING(name))
>     SELECT family.name FROM ancestor_of_alice, family
>      WHERE ancestor_of_alice.name=family.name
>        AND died IS NULL
>      ORDER BY born;

<span id="rcex3"></span>

## 3.3. Queries Against A Graph

Suppose you have an undirected graph where each node is identified by an
integer and edges are defined by a table like this:

>     CREATE TABLE edge(aa INT, bb INT);
>     CREATE INDEX edge_aa ON edge(aa);
>     CREATE INDEX edge_bb ON edge(bb);

The indexes are not required, but they do help performance for large
graphs. To find all nodes of the graph that are connected to node 59,
use a query similar to the following:

>     WITH RECURSIVE nodes(x) AS (
>        SELECT 59
>        UNION
>        SELECT aa FROM edge JOIN nodes ON bb=x
>        UNION
>        SELECT bb FROM edge JOIN nodes ON aa=x
>     )
>     SELECT x FROM nodes;

The <span class="yyterm">initial-select</span> in this case is the
simple query "SELECT 59". This establishes the base case. The
<span class="yyterm">recursive-select</span> consists of the other two
SELECT statements. The first recursive SELECT follows edges in the
bb-to-aa direction and the second recursive SELECT follows edges in the
aa-to-bb direction. UNION is used instead of UNION ALL to prevent the
recursion from entering an infinite loop if the graph contains cycles.

Here is a real-world example of using a graph query against a directed
graph: A version control system (VCS) will typically store the evolving
versions of a project as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Call each
version of the project a "checkin". A single checkin can have zero or
more parents. Most checkins (except the first) have a single parent, but
in the case of a merge, a checkin might have two or three or more
parents. A schema to keep track of checkins and the order in which they
occur might look something like this:

>     CREATE TABLE checkin(
>       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
>       mtime INTEGER -- timestamp when this checkin occurred
>     );
>     CREATE TABLE derivedfrom(
>       xfrom INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES checkin, -- parent checkin
>       xto INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES checkin,   -- derived checkin
>       PRIMARY KEY(xfrom,xto)
>     );
>     CREATE INDEX derivedfrom_back ON derivedfrom(xto,xfrom);

This graph is acyclic. And we assume that the mtime of every child
checkin is no less than the mtime of all its parents. But unlike the
earlier examples, this graph might have multiple paths of differing
lengths between any two checkins.

We want to know the twenty most recent ancestors in time (out of the
thousands and thousands of ancestors in the whole DAG) for checkin
"@BASELINE". (A query similar to this is used by the
<a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/" target="_blank">Fossil</a> VCS to
show the N most recent ancestors of a checkin. For example:
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?p=trunk&amp;n=30"
target="_blank">https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?p=trunk&amp;n=30</a>.)

>     WITH RECURSIVE
>       ancestor(id,mtime) AS (
>         SELECT id, mtime FROM checkin WHERE id=@BASELINE
>         UNION
>         SELECT derivedfrom.xfrom, checkin.mtime
>           FROM ancestor, derivedfrom, checkin
>          WHERE ancestor.id=derivedfrom.xto
>            AND checkin.id=derivedfrom.xfrom
>          ORDER BY checkin.mtime DESC
>          LIMIT 20
>       )
>     SELECT * FROM checkin JOIN ancestor USING(id);

The "ORDER BY checkin.mtime DESC" term in the recursive-select makes the
query run much faster by preventing it from following branches that
merge checkins from long ago. The ORDER BY forces the recursive-select
to focus on the most recent checkins, the ones we want. Without the
ORDER BY on the recursive-select, one would be forced to compute the
complete set of thousands of ancestors, sort them all by mtime, then
take the top twenty. The ORDER BY essentially sets up a priority queue
that forces the recursive query to look at the most recent ancestors
first, allowing the use of a LIMIT clause to restrict the scope of the
query to just the checkins of interest. <span id="withorderby"></span>

## 3.4. Controlling Depth-First Versus Breadth-First Search Of a Tree Using ORDER BY

An ORDER BY clause on the recursive-select can be used to control
whether the search of a tree is depth-first or breadth-first. To
illustrate, we will use a variation on the "org" table from an example
above, without the "height" column, and with some real data inserted:

>     CREATE TABLE org(
>       name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
>       boss TEXT REFERENCES org
>     ) WITHOUT ROWID;
>     INSERT INTO org VALUES('Alice',NULL);
>     INSERT INTO org VALUES('Bob','Alice');
>     INSERT INTO org VALUES('Cindy','Alice');
>     INSERT INTO org VALUES('Dave','Bob');
>     INSERT INTO org VALUES('Emma','Bob');
>     INSERT INTO org VALUES('Fred','Cindy');
>     INSERT INTO org VALUES('Gail','Cindy');

Here is a query to show the tree structure in a breadth-first pattern:

>     WITH RECURSIVE
>       under_alice(name,level) AS (
>         VALUES('Alice',0)
>         UNION ALL
>         SELECT org.name, under_alice.level+1
>           FROM org JOIN under_alice ON org.boss=under_alice.name
>          ORDER BY 2
>       )
>     SELECT substr('..........',1,level*3) || name FROM under_alice;

The "ORDER BY 2" (which means the same as "ORDER BY
under_alice.level+1") causes higher levels in the organization chart
(with smaller "level" values) to be processed first, resulting in a
breadth-first search. The output is:

>     Alice
>     ...Bob
>     ...Cindy
>     ......Dave
>     ......Emma
>     ......Fred
>     ......Gail

But if we change the ORDER BY clause to add the "DESC" modifier, that
will cause lower levels in the organization (with larger "level" values)
to be processed first by the recursive-select, resulting in a
depth-first search:

>     WITH RECURSIVE
>       under_alice(name,level) AS (
>         VALUES('Alice',0)
>         UNION ALL
>         SELECT org.name, under_alice.level+1
>           FROM org JOIN under_alice ON org.boss=under_alice.name
>          ORDER BY 2 DESC
>       )
>     SELECT substr('..........',1,level*3) || name FROM under_alice;

The output of this revised query is:

>     Alice
>     ...Bob
>     ......Dave
>     ......Emma
>     ...Cindy
>     ......Fred
>     ......Gail

When the ORDER BY clause is omitted from the recursive-select, the queue
behaves as a FIFO, which results in a breadth-first search.

## 3.5. Outlandish Recursive Query Examples

The following query computes an approximation of the Mandelbrot Set and
outputs the result as ASCII-art:

>     WITH RECURSIVE
>       xaxis(x) AS (VALUES(-2.0) UNION ALL SELECT x+0.05 FROM xaxis WHERE x<1.2),
>       yaxis(y) AS (VALUES(-1.0) UNION ALL SELECT y+0.1 FROM yaxis WHERE y<1.0),
>       m(iter, cx, cy, x, y) AS (
>         SELECT 0, x, y, 0.0, 0.0 FROM xaxis, yaxis
>         UNION ALL
>         SELECT iter+1, cx, cy, x*x-y*y + cx, 2.0*x*y + cy FROM m 
>          WHERE (x*x + y*y) < 4.0 AND iter<28
>       ),
>       m2(iter, cx, cy) AS (
>         SELECT max(iter), cx, cy FROM m GROUP BY cx, cy
>       ),
>       a(t) AS (
>         SELECT group_concat( substr(' .+*#', 1+min(iter/7,4), 1), '') 
>         FROM m2 GROUP BY cy
>       )
>     SELECT group_concat(rtrim(t),x'0a') FROM a;

In this query, the "xaxis" and "yaxis" CTEs define the grid of points
for which the Mandelbrot Set will be approximated. Each row in the
"m(iter,cx,cy,x,y)" CTE means that after "iter" iterations, the
Mandelbrot iteration starting at cx,cy has reached point x,y. The number
of iterations in this example is limited to 28 (which severely limits
the resolution of the computation, but is sufficient for low-resolution
ASCII-art output). The "m2(iter,cx,cy)" CTE holds the maximum number of
iterations reached when starting at point cx,cy. Finally, each row in
the "a(t)" CTE holds a string which is a single line of the output
ASCII-art. The SELECT statement at the end just queries the "a" CTE to
retrieve all lines of ASCII-art, one by one.

Running the query above in an SQLite
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html" target="_blank">command-line
shell</a> results in the following output:

>                                         ....#

<span id="sudoku"></span>

This next query solves a Sudoku puzzle. The state of the puzzle is
defined by an 81-character string formed by reading entries from the
puzzle box row by row from left to right and then from top to bottom.
Blank squares in the puzzle are denoted by a "." character. Thus the
input string:

<blockquote>
53..7....6..195....98....6.8...6...34..8.3..17...2...6.6....28....419..5....8..79
</blockquote>

Corresponds to a puzzle like this:

The "input" CTE defines the input puzzle. The "digits" CTE defines a
table that holds all digits between 1 and 9. The work of solving the
puzzle is undertaken by the "x" CTE. An entry in x(s,ind) means that the
81-character string "s" is a valid sudoku puzzle (it has no conflicts)
and that the first unknown character is at position "ind", or ind==0 if
all character positions are filled in. The goal, then, is to compute
entries for "x" with an "ind" of 0.

The solver works by adding new entries to the "x" recursive table. Given
prior entries, the recursive-select tries to fill in a single new
position with all values between 1 and 9 that actually work in that
position. The complicated "NOT EXISTS" subquery is the magic that
figures out whether or not each candidate "s" string is a valid sudoku
puzzle or not.

The final answer is found by looking for a string with ind==0. If the
original sudoku problem did not have a unique solution, then the query
will return all possible solutions. If the original problem was
unsolvable, then no rows will be returned. In this case, the unique
answer is:

## 4. Materialization Hints

The "AS MATERIALIZED" and "AS NOT MATERIALIZED" forms of a common table
expression are non-standard SQL syntax copied from PostgreSQL. Using
MATERIALIZED or NOT MATERIALIZED after the AS keyword provides
non-binding hints to the query planner about how the CTE should be
implemented.

If the MATERIALIZED phrase is used, then
<span class="yynonterm">select-stmt</span> will be materialized into an
ephemeral table that is held in memory or in a temporary disk file. That
ephemeral table will then be used in place of the CTE table name
whenever the CTE table name appears in the subsequent SQL. Because the
<span class="yynonterm">select-stmt</span> is evaluated immediately, the
opportunity to apply optimizations such as
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html#flattening"
target="_blank">query flattening</a> or the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html#pushdown"
target="_blank">push-down optimization</a>, is lost. This loss of
optimization is a feature, not a bug. Developers are able to use the
MATERIALIZED keyword as an "optimization fence" to more tightly control
the behavior of the SQLite query planner. SQLite copied the idea of
using MATERIALIZED as an optimization fence from PostgreSQL.

If the NOT MATERIALIZED phrase is used, then
<span class="yynonterm">select-stmt</span> is substituted as a subquery
in place of every occurrence of the CTE table name. Optimizations such
as <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html#flattening"
target="_blank">flattening</a> and
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html#pushdown"
target="_blank">push-down</a> are then applied to the subquery as if the
subquery had by used in directly. In spite of its name, the NOT
MATERIALIZED phrase does not prohibit the use of materialization. The
query planner is still free to implement the subquery using
materialization if it feels that is the best solution. The true meaning
of NOT MATERIALIZED is closer to "TREAT LIKE ANY ORDINARY VIEW OR
SUBQUERY".

If neither hint is present, then SQLite is free to choose whatever
implementation strategy it thinks will work best. This is the
recommended approach. *Do not use the MATERIALIZED or NOT MATERIALIZED
keywords on a common table expression unless you have a compelling
reason to do so.*

The MATERIALIZED and NOT MATERIALIZED hints are only available in SQLite
version 3.35.0 (2021-03-12) and later.

## 5. Limitations And Caveats

- The WITH clause cannot be used within a [CREATE
  TRIGGER](lang_createtrigger).

- The WITH clause must appear at the beginning of a top-level
  [SELECT](lang_select) statement or at the beginning of a subquery. The
  WITH clause cannot be prepended to the second or subsequent SELECT
  statement of a [compound select](lang_select#compound).

- The SQL:1999 spec requires that the RECURSIVE keyword follow WITH in
  any WITH clause that includes a recursive common table expression.
  However, for compatibility with SqlServer and Oracle, SQLite does not
  enforce this rule.
