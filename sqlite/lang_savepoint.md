## 2. Savepoints

SAVEPOINTs are a method of creating transactions, similar to
[BEGIN](lang_transaction) and [COMMIT](lang_transaction), except that
the SAVEPOINT and RELEASE commands are named and may be nested.

The SAVEPOINT command starts a new transaction with a name. The
transaction names need not be unique. A SAVEPOINT can be started either
within or outside of a
[BEGIN](lang_transaction)...[COMMIT](lang_transaction). When a SAVEPOINT
is the outer-most savepoint and it is not within a
[BEGIN](lang_transaction)...[COMMIT](lang_transaction) then the behavior
is the same as BEGIN DEFERRED TRANSACTION.

The ROLLBACK TO command reverts the state of the database back to what
it was just after the corresponding SAVEPOINT. Note that unlike that
plain [ROLLBACK](lang_transaction) command (without the TO keyword) the
ROLLBACK TO command does not cancel the transaction. Instead of
cancelling the transaction, the ROLLBACK TO command restarts the
transaction again at the beginning. All intervening SAVEPOINTs are
canceled, however.

The RELEASE command is like a [COMMIT](lang_transaction) for a
SAVEPOINT. The RELEASE command causes all savepoints back to and
including the most recent savepoint with a matching name to be removed
from the transaction stack. The RELEASE of an inner transaction does not
cause any changes to be written to the database file; it merely removes
savepoints from the transaction stack such that it is no longer possible
to ROLLBACK TO those savepoints. If a RELEASE command releases the
outermost savepoint, so that the transaction stack becomes empty, then
RELEASE is the same as [COMMIT](lang_transaction). The
[COMMIT](lang_transaction) command may be used to release all savepoints
and commit the transaction even if the transaction was originally
started by a SAVEPOINT command instead of a [BEGIN](lang_transaction)
command.

If the savepoint-name in a RELEASE command does not match any savepoint
currently in the transaction stack, then no savepoints are released, the
database is unchanged, and the RELEASE command returns an error.

Note that an inner transaction might commit (using the RELEASE command)
but then later have its work undone by a ROLLBACK in an outer
transaction. A power failure or program crash or OS crash will cause the
outer-most transaction to rollback, undoing all changes that have
occurred within that outer transaction, even changes that have
supposedly been "committed" by the RELEASE command. Content is not
actually committed on the disk until the outermost transaction commits.

There are several ways of thinking about the RELEASE command:

- Some people view RELEASE as the equivalent of COMMIT for a SAVEPOINT.
  This is an acceptable point of view as long as one remembers that the
  changes committed by an inner transaction might later be undone by a
  rollback in an outer transaction.

- Another view of RELEASE is that it merges a named transaction into its
  parent transaction, so that the named transaction and its parent
  become the same transaction. After RELEASE, the named transaction and
  its parent will commit or rollback together, whatever their fate may
  be.

- One can also think of savepoints as "marks" in the transaction
  timeline. In this view, the SAVEPOINT command creates a new mark, the
  ROLLBACK TO command rewinds the timeline back to a point just after
  the named mark, and the RELEASE command erases marks from the timeline
  without actually making any changes to the database.

## 3. Transaction Nesting Rules

The last transaction started will be the first transaction committed or
rolled back.

The [BEGIN](lang_transaction) command only works if the transaction
stack is empty, or in other words if there are no pending transactions.
If the transaction stack is not empty when the [BEGIN](lang_transaction)
command is invoked, then the command fails with an error.

The [COMMIT](lang_transaction) command commits all outstanding
transactions and leaves the transaction stack empty.

The RELEASE command starts with the most recent addition to the
transaction stack and releases savepoints backwards in time until it
releases a savepoint with a matching savepoint-name. Prior savepoints,
even savepoints with matching savepoint-names, are unchanged. If the
RELEASE command causes the transaction stack to become empty (if the
RELEASE command releases the outermost transaction from the stack) then
the transaction commits.

The [ROLLBACK](lang_transaction) command without a TO clause rolls backs
all transactions and leaves the transaction stack empty.

The ROLLBACK command with a TO clause rolls back transactions going
backwards in time back to the most recent SAVEPOINT with a matching
name. The SAVEPOINT with the matching name remains on the transaction
stack, but all database changes that occurred after that SAVEPOINT was
created are rolled back. If the savepoint-name in a ROLLBACK TO command
does not match any SAVEPOINT on the stack, then the ROLLBACK command
fails with an error and leaves the state of the database unchanged.
